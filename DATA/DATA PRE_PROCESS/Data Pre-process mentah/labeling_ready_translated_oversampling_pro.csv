2025-04-06,Noga is an indispensable journalist (there are too few Israel-related reporters in English like her who are neither in thrall to far right hasbara nor to far left hadashbara). That being said this tweet needs to be qualified: the Supreme Court has not yet issued such a ruling.

2025-04-06,Antisemites have no right going to Israel. And Israel has the right to deny them entry. Lammy is a POS.
2025-04-06,@JoshFG They weren't unjustly detained they were kicked out. One is from China one from Yemen both support Palestine and criticised Israel. They lied saying they were on a parliamentary delegation. Israel has the right to block people and Kemi said they had that right.
2025-04-06,Revolution/Liberty/Freedom/Voluntarism/Rebellion = disestablishmentarianism Government/Voters = antidisestablishmentarianism Zionist Hoard (say that Jews are God's chosen people Israel has the right to exist that they are a Jew) = Amalekites(plural) Amalek(singular)
2024-04-07,@RishiSunak Israel does not have the legal right to self-defense in the lands it occupies as the owners of the land have the legitimate right to resistance and the right to self-determination. Listen to UN expert https://t.co/8XIQs1Xqez
2023-12-11,@TomCottonAR Israel does not have a right to defend itself from people it has occupied and put a brutal siege on for the past 16 years. The only right Israel has under international law is to end the occupation and stop the siege.
2025-03-18,FACT: Under international law as long as Hamas is holding hostages and refusing to engage in good faith negotiations to extend the ceasefire in Gaza Israel like any sovereign nation is fully entitled to take decisive military action. https://t.co/547JWnIlTD
2023-12-04,@VP Nope. Israel does not have that right. According to International Humanitarian law the occupying power has no right to self-defense in the area it occupies. The occupied people have the right to self-defense.
2025-04-06,Israel has the right to deny entry to individuals who pose a security risk. It's not about anti-Israel hatred but about protecting their borders. @DavidLammy should respect Israel's decision and the need for security in the region.
2025-04-06,Israel has the right to imprison the Americans in the USA for free speech says Trump . https://t.co/6Wtu8CF0NB
2024-09-10,No the israelis do NOT have a right to defend themselves in Gaza.. but the Palestinians do says basic morality and international humanitarian law https://t.co/z0z7iRnvsJ
2024-10-29,@EliAfriatISR 1. Israel has a right to protect its borders. 2. Israeli people have a right to live without fear of being massacred. 3. The land belongs to Israel. 4. The God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob gave it to them and NOTHING can change that. NOTHING ️🇮🇱
2023-11-15,According to international law Israel does not have the right to self defence because it is an occupying power. So no Israel does not have the right to defend itself.
2023-12-30,Just to be clear Israel is the occupying force it has no lawful right to self defence (or genocide) within the territory it occupies. Gaza is occupied &amp;;
2025-04-06,@wesstreeting @YuanfenYang You really are that naive It doesn t matter who they are They hate Israel and Israel has the bloody right to refuse them entry But hey we let any terrorist or British hating peoples in here

2024-09-29,For the millionth fucking time: Israel has NO right to defend itself because it is ILLEGALLY OCCUPYING PALESTINE and ILLEGALLY ATTACKING LEBANON. Stop debating this canard. Palestine and Lebanon DO have the right to defend themselves under international law. Always. Stop
2024-11-19,@NewsHour @nickschifrin @JakeSullivan46 Wrong israel has no right whatsoever. Occupiers can never claim defense against those they occupy since the very state of occupation is in itself an act of aggression. Palestinians on the other hand have full right to armed resistance as stated by int l law.
2025-04-06,if you can see past all of the atrocities israel has committed and still believe they have a right to that land- indigenous people love their land. This is now how indigenous people treat the land they love. Israel has destroyed it out of blind hate
2024-01-22,Under international law Israel has no right to defend itself from occupied people. Occupied people have the right to resist with any means. But then again what would I know I only worked torward a Ph.D. covering international law teach lecture and write in the area.
2025-04-06,Breaking Israel has the right to refuse any MP who tells false lies and writes untruths online Well done Israel.
2024-11-03,Because the israeli occupation is already in place the RIGHT to initiate militarised force in response is a Palestinian right and NOT an israeli one https://t.co/V1PneAxcPM
2023-11-22,@DrEliDavid @Gregsy_reborn Under international law Israel is an occupier of Gaza. Israel has no legal right to fight back against a legitimate act of resistance from an occupied territory or people. What they do have the right to do is REMOVE themselves from the Occupied territory. You can whine and moan
2024-02-10,@EylonALevy Serious response. Because per international law Palestinians have the right to defend ourselves against occupation. Israel has NO right to occupy and siege Palestine. Plus we all know what will happen if Palestinians surrender. Yall have said enough about turning Gaza into
2023-10-20,No Israel does not have the right to defend itself. How can an illegitimate state which stole the land and ethnically cleansed it have the right to anything?
2025-04-06,The group she is talking about is led by the Rothschild's ! Study history and join the dots! There is no need to be a genius to understand! Who is behind Israel? Israel is behind everything and has even the right to commit genocide. Why do you think they work in the shadows!
2025-04-06,Kemi Badenoch thinks Israel has the right to control its borders. Colossal ignorance @KemiBadenoch. Israel has no properly defined borders. Like a malignant tumour it invades occupies and colonizes surrounding states. https://t.co/IYfRs9exqQ
2025-04-06,Israel has the right to fuck the decent citizens of America says Trump .
2023-10-10,Yes you may think Israel has the right to defend itself. Under international law Israel does not have the right to defend itself.
2025-04-06,Every sovereign nation has the right to deny entry to those who seek to undermine fabricate and cause mayhem. These two Hamas shills are no exception. Good move by Israel. British MPs barred from entering Israel complain of treatment https://t.co/nCTV0L8Lu1
2024-09-12,No Israel does not have a right to defend itself in Gaza. But the Palestinians do. Written by @CraigMokhiber. https://t.co/FG3rFp8XDF
2024-11-18,The oppressed not the oppressor have the right to self-defense. And international law agrees. https://t.co/FG3rFp9vtd
2025-02-27,It s actually the exact opposite. Palestine has a legitimate right to sovereignty over all of historic Palestine. It has accepted what it calls a Historic Compromise to accept Israeli sovereignty over pre-1967 borders as the basis for settling the issue of Israeli secession
2024-11-21,@NikkiHaley An occupying power cannot justify acts of violence or use military force against a population it's legally obligated to protect. In short fuck you Israel does not have the right to protect itself from the people it occupies. Don't like resistance? End the occupation.
2025-04-06,@DVATW I understand they were to visit the illegally occupied West Bank. If they flew to Tel Aviv then Israel has the right to determine who can enter Israel - should have flown to jorda and if denied access to the WB from there by the illegal occupiers then that's unacceptable.
2023-12-14,@SenSanders No Israel doesn t have the right to defend itself in a land that it occupies but the people occupied have the right to resist according to international law. Listen to The UN expert on the occupied Palestinian land https://t.co/Sefow9MNe2
2024-12-30,@UKUN_NewYork @BWoodward_UN Israel doesn't have a right to genocide according to international law set by ICJ

2023-11-03,Russia is correct. To claim that Israel an occupying state has a right to self-defense is absurd. It is like claiming that a HOME INVADER who has forced his way into someone's home has a right to defend himself against the homeowner.
2024-03-11,Israel has zero right to defend themselves according to international law because they are an occupying force squatting on someone else s land.

2024-05-20,@RepRudyYakym Under international law Israel does not have the right to self defense as a belligerent occupier. Stop lying to the people. If they want to end Hamas they need to end the occupation.
2023-10-12,Israel does not have the right to exist as a religious ethnostate or defend its existence as such. What this means is simply that it does not have the right to occupy ethnically cleanse and settle foreign territories or pursue a given racial or religious demographic composition.
2025-04-06,FANTASTIC! Hamas' relentless terror attacks on innocent Israeli civilians MUST be condemned! Israel has the RIGHT to defend itself against these barbaric acts. The world must stand with Israel NOT enable Hamas' hate. Torah teaches us to protect life. https://t.co/ZWHbLjstpD
2024-10-07,Israel does not have the right to defend itself against the people they occupy. It s wild how many of you still don t understand this.
2024-09-28,@mehdirhasan No one has the right to aggress as Hezbollah did and Lebanon allowed on 10/8 and thousands of times since. Israel has the right to war to end that aggression.
2025-03-09,@piersmorgan No it is not wrong. And no it isn't wrong that Israel retains the power to do it. https://t.co/GENuaCGUac
2024-10-31,Actually Israel does NOT have a right to defend itself. It is an occupying power Palestinians have the right of resistance (including violent resistance) under international law and as an occupying power Israel is barred from harming the people whose land it occupies -- and
2024-03-09,@EylonALevy @faniaoz According to the international law the Israelis do not have the legal right to self-defense because they are occupiers and the owners of the land have the right to resist the occupier.
2024-05-20,@Ostrov_A @IntlCrimCourt @KarimKhanQC You're wrong... again! Israel is the terrorist breaking UN resolutions and international law. No law gives Israel the right to carry out collective punishment and a genocide. Palestinians on the other hand have the legal right to defend themselves against the occupier. https://t.co/qSYhdULlDW
2024-09-02,.@abcnews .@ABCmediawatch Israel does NOT have the right to militarily defend itself in Gaza under international law. It is the occupying power. Every single time you make &amp;;
2023-11-16,@piersmorgan No Israel cannot claim the right of self-defense against a threat that emanates from a territory it occupies.
2024-10-21,@NathanJRobinson International law says Palestinians have the right to violent resistance against Israel's illegal occupation of their land.
2023-11-03,@SecBlinken @gantzbe International law says that Israel has no right to self-defense as long as it occupies Palestine. https://t.co/XyDvCeLZ9l
2024-09-28,Israel has been perfectly clear: they believe they own Palestine that it is completely theirs to do whatever they like with it and Palestinians deserve only such rights as Israelis are willing to give them. This is the fundamental fact of the conflict often obscured in the US. https://t.co/W1PrPeqMV4
2025-04-06,unheard of! Israel has every right to defend itself &amp;;
2025-02-06,@972mag @rulajebreal @yuval_abraham @mekomit For starters israel has no right whatsoever to kill a single Palestinian or have even one IOF militant anywhere in Palestine. Armed resistance is legal. Decades of israeli settlements and occupation are not.
2023-11-06,Correction @JustinTrudeau: Israel doesn't have the right to self-defence against a non-state actor under its occupation (art. 51 of UN Charter). And parties engaging in war must adhere to IHL principles protecting civilians. There is no justification for genocide.
2025-04-06,Isreal has the right to refuse entry into its country if those people spread anti Israel propaganda.
2023-11-04,TIL that under international law: Israel as an occupying force in Gaza does not have the right to defend itself Gazans an occupied people facing genocide do have the right to defend themselves Sending weapons to a government commiting human rights violations is illegal
2025-01-19,@JoelWBerry It s not up to you. Israel and the United States have ZERO authority or right to determine the fate of the Palestinians. If anything should be shut down it s the apartheid state of Israel.
2024-01-13,Does Israel have a right of self-defence under international law? No. As UN Special Rapporteur @FranceskAlbs explains: Israel cannot claim the right of self-defence against a threat that emanates from the territory that it occupies. https://t.co/BDZmhN0v80
2024-01-26,@QudsNen Under international law Israel as an occupying force does NOT have the right to defend itself against those it occupies.
2025-03-09,@piersmorgan You are hopelessly naive. The Arabs in Israel have every right enjoyed by Jews and others. Arabs in Gaza had every right allowed by Hamas. Israel did not withhold rights from anyone based on race or religion unlike the Muslims.
2023-10-24,@davidschor According to international law the people of Palestine have a legal right to armed resistance against occupation.
2024-10-20,Now is the time to shout it louder than ever before. COLONIZED PEOPLE HAVE THE RIGHT TO ARMED RESISTANCE https://t.co/hl5TsFE8LF
2023-12-02,@Israel @lucyaharish Israelis have no right according to any law in the world to defend themselves because they are simply an occupying force in Palestine (only the law of gangs allows this) while the Palestinians have the full right to your armed resistance.

2023-11-15,Israel actually does not have the right to defend itself because it's not the one being occupied. Great explanation of the law!
2023-11-04,️ Israel does NOT have right of self-defence under Article 51 of UN Charter to wage a war on Gaza. It is already occupies the Gaza Strip. The International Court warned in Wall case that Article 51 self defence does not apply to territory under Israel's effective control
