29/10/2023;Israel is a small island of 10 million people surrounded by hundreds of millions of Arabs. The country that gave 187 Nobel winners. One of the most educated populations in the world on the 3rd place in the world at Unicorns after the US and China a fascinating business culture. That is worth defending;p;

11/10/2023;U1S1, the Israel that Laos in the wall imagined is actually similar to the China they dream of. 1. Israel adheres to traditional culture, opposes other races, and maintains national purity. Opposes Muslims and blacks. 2. Those who violate our Israelites will be punished even if they are far away. 3. Good economic development and high per capita GDP. But now Israel is in pro-American territory, and pinks will start to stand on the edge of terrorist organizations without any brains.;p;

11/01/2024;Only a full full -fledged right -wing government can bring the largest disaster to Israel since the establishment of the state and also bring Israel to the situation that is the one that is at trial because of populist statements.;p;
06/04/2025;Where s the outrage from Western leaders like Australia s Prime Minister @AlboMP ?? 490 children slaughtered by Isr*el in just a period of 20 days. And I bet Albo does nothing about stopping Australian manufactured weapons material being sent to Isr*el. #auspol;p;
03/06/2024;I already explained it 1000 times but the public is renewed. The rounded in blue says (Alef Iut in Hebrew) Eretz Israel is to say the land of Israel or the Jewish earth.
